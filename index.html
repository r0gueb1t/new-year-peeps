    <h1>Happy New Year Peeps...!</h1>

        <p>🙋🏻‍♂️ So yeah, the title is pretty much self explanatory, but that doesn't cut it.
            More than just a wish, this is a big thanks from me to you...!
            <br><br>
            🫂 2025 was a very bad year for me. I swear. I had my greatest falls this year
            and I wouldn't have made it through the year without you.
            <br><br>
            🫶🏻 I am forever grateful to each and every one of you who stood with me throughout 
            the year. This is to those who spammed me with reels, to those who called me 
            different funny names, to those who taught me stuff when I needed, to those who
            gave me advice just when I needed. 
            <br><br>
            ❤️‍🔥 This is a big big biiiiiiig THANK YOU to all of you...!
        </p>

    
        <p>🎇 Also, being New Year, I should obviously wish you guys too, right? Well, here goes -
            <br><br>
            🍾 Happy New Year to each and everyone of you! Stay wild, stay crazy, stay dumb.
            <br><br>
            🫱🏻‍🫲🏻 I wish that 2026 brings to you what you want. But more than than that, I wish that 
            you have the strength to face whatever 2026 throws to you. That you don't lose little
            pieces of yourself. Don't lose what makes you special. I love you guys for all 
            the little differences we have. I love you all for different reasons and I love those 
            reasons as well...! 
            <br><br>
            Remember - 2026 won't be kind.
            <br><br>
            But don't let that strip you of your whimsy and joy and kindness. We can push through it, together 💗.
            <br>
            (Also being a 15 year old, my "advice" could be wrong, but it is what it is.)

            These pics are things that I will carry in my heart.
            <br>
            All of you taught many great lessons to me. I'm very happy to have
            been blessed with you guys as my seniors. (And the super seniors before that toooooo)
            <br>
            Also, if you are not here, that's because I don't have a photo with you
            (yet).
            Don't worry. I will hunt you down with a camera hehehehehe.
            <br>
            Also, the only reason you are seeing this website right now is because I trust you (and that
            you haven't shared it to anyone, which you shouldn't :)).
        </p>

            A special thanks to the motta puffs and narangavellam gang - you know who

            <br>
            In a way, all of you are mutta puffs and narangavellam in my life.
